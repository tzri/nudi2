# Nudi² – Ultra Minimal WordPress Theme (Nudi2)

## Manifesto
*I believe in a web where content stands on its own.*  
*Where structure matters more than surface.*  
*Where clarity isn't styled – it's built in.*  

*I believe the future won't scroll, it will query.*  
*Websites won't be browsed – they’ll be analyzed.*  

**nudi2 is built for future – and the future is now!**  
A theme with nothing extra, and nothing to hide.
